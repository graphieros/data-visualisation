graphBar.js
> manipulates height of divs depending on data sorted from a HTML table. It displays a bar chart sorted from smallest to highest value.

graphLine.js
> creates a line chart using SVG coordinates based on data from a HTML table. Here data is not sorted by value as it must represent historic evolution.

sortGraphLine.js
> creates a line chart using SVG coordinates based on data from a HTML table. Checkboxes allow to toggle opacity of the lines, for a better read of a given line. Not sorted by value (historic evolution). Two lines are used for this snippet. However code appears to nest too many repetitions. Need to find a way to avoid that.

monthChart.js
> generates random monthly data for a current period and a previous period, and displays a line chart on a canvas.

graphBar2.js
> generates random monthly data for a current period and a previous period, and displays a histogram chart on a canvas.

divChart.js (my personal fav for now)
> generates random data and displays a histogram chart built with DIV elements, allowing easy styling with css. Hovering each histogram will display its data.

svgChart.js
> generates random data and displays a line chart built with SVG, with event handlers to highlight data when a plot is hovered, or to highlight a plot when data is hovered.
