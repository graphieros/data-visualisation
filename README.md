**** library material

*** copy paste material

**  usable

\*   noob beginnings, not scalable

<hr/>

histoDiv.js ***
> an optimized bar chart built with DIVS. Light, responsive, and prone to nice event handling. CSS grid parameters used in JS to make it scalable. Ideal for data sets of 2 to 36 items (weeks, months, years...).
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/histoDiv.js)</code>

waffleChart.js ***
> generates 3 series of random data and displays a waffle chart built with DIVS, under which are also 3 line charts for each data series. Pretty proud of this one :)
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/waffleChart.js)</code>

svgChart.js **
> generates random data and displays a line chart built with SVG, with event handlers to highlight data when a plot is hovered, or to highlight a plot when data is hovered.
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/svgChart.js)</code>

divChart.js *
> generates random data and displays a histogram chart built with DIV elements, allowing easy styling with css. Hovering each histogram will display its data.
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/divChart.js)</code>

graphBar2.js *
> generates random monthly data for a current period and a previous period, and displays a histogram chart on a canvas.
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/graphBar2.js)</code>

monthChart.js *
> generates random monthly data for a current period and a previous period, and displays a line chart on a canvas.
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/monthChart.js)</code>

sortGraphLine.js *
> creates a line chart using SVG coordinates based on data from a HTML table. Checkboxes allow to toggle opacity of the lines, for a better read of a given line. Not sorted by value (historic evolution). Two lines are used for this snippet. However code appears to nest too many repetitions. Need to find a way to avoid that.
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/sortGraphLine.js)</code>

graphLine.js *
> creates a line chart using SVG coordinates based on data from a HTML table. Here data is not sorted by value as it must represent historic evolution.
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/graphLine.js)</code>

graphBar.js *
> manipulates height of divs depending on data sorted from a HTML table. It displays a bar chart sorted from smallest to highest value.
<code>[code](https://github.com/graphieros/data-visualisation/blob/master/js/graphBar.js)</code>
