I'm learning js without using frameworks for now.
For the moment I'm into data visualization. I searched online for help on how to build charts using pure js, but didn't find anything to my satisfaction, so I'm trying to make it on my own. I think trying to reinvent the wheel is cool, because you get to understand what a wheel really is. Mistakes are awesome.
